Graph Cycle Homework

This Java program determines the cycle in a given graph text file.
In order to run the program, you must first compile both the
GraphCycle.java and GraphData.java as the cycle used the data class
to hold information about the vertex along with the corresponding edges.

Compile command example : javac GraphCycle.java GraphData.java

To run the program, there will be three arguments. The graphCycle, the
graphData and the text file of the graph that you want to find the cycle
in.

Run command example : java GraphCycle GraphData g2.txt

There is also a Makefile that can be used when running the program.
To compile the program, use the following command without quotes "make"
and to run the command without quotes use the command "make run".
